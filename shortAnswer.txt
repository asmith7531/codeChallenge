3) Both return 
syntax error, unexpected '{', expecting ';'

4) function _construct is a  way to define a constructor in PHP.
Every time a new instance of the class is created, the code in the constructor will be executed on the new instance. 
Another way to deine a constructor is to create a function in the class with the same name as the class.

5) I prefer React to Angular because react uses the virtual DOM making it faster than Angular. Angular has more out of the box 
functionality than React which only handles views, but with libraries like react-router you can still get what you need from react 
you ae just the one responsible for setting it up correctly. Angular seems to be better at creating larger cohesive websites 
for enterprises. I like JSX. Being able to structure html inside of javascript files of the component that will be rendered makes 
the code easier to read and understand for me. I also really like that React and React native being so simlar means that alot of 
code can be reused when making mobile versions of your app. But that may also be true of NativeScript, I have not experienced 
developing with it yet. 

6) Interfaces are rules used when implementing classes. Interfaces cannot have concrete methods, 
only abstract ones, and they cannot instantiate themselves but classes can instantiate them. Abstract 
classes are classes that have one or more abstract methods (methods without a body) and any number of 
concrete methods. They are also blue prints for classes like interfaces, but they come with some baked 
in functionality via their concrete methods. 

7) Static is used to make properties and methods of a class accessible without having an instantiation of the class

8) Strpos returns the start value  so since yaba is in the first position, it returns 0.  
echo "\"" . $str1 . "\" contains \"" . $str2 . "\""; will only run if it returns true, which strpos will never do. 

Fixed by changing the if conditional statement to != null. This way if any integer is returned, the first option will be executed, 
else if false is returned because string1 does not contain string2, the else statement will be executed. 

$str1 = 'yabadabadoo';
$str2 = 'yaba';
if (strpos($str1,$str2)!==false) {
    echo "\"" . $str1 . "\" contains \"" . $str2 . "\"";
} else {
    echo "\"" . $str1 . "\" does not contain \"" . $str2 . "\"";
}
